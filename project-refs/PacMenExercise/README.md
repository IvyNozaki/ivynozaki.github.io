Pacman moves randomly within the the set parameters of the game screen. Snack pellets will randomly drop from the top of the game screen.

The **STOP** button refreshes the game screen.

The **EAT** button is to make Pacman eat the pellet that it is currently in contact with.

## **Road Map**

1. Add a speed feature that either speeds up or slows down pacman's movement.

2. Add a challenge.

- Add ghosts that drop down randomly like the pellets that will end game upon contact with pacman.
- Set consequence for missed snack pellets.
- Increase drop speed as score passes certain points.

3. Allow player to move Pacman using arrow keys but continue to Pacman move randomly when arrow keys not in use.
